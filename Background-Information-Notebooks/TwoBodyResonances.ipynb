    "When the B meson decays into three hadrons, it can do so either directly or by decaying into one hadron and a neutral intermediate particle. A process like the latter would for example be B<sup>+</sup> → h<sup>+</sup>R<sup>0</sup>. This intermediate particle, R<sup>0</sup>, would then continue to decay into the two other oppositely charged hadrons, R<sup>0</sup> → h<sup>+</sup>h<sup>-</sup>.\n",

    "The analysis in this project examines the decay of charmless B mesons to pions and kaons, but the most frequent decays of the B meson occur through the b quark decaying into a c quark. This latter process would be considered background, so that we need to exlude events which include c quarks. One event to exclude would for example be the decay process including a  a D meson (which contains a c quark). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of eliminating background is the exclusion of misidentified tracks in the detector. A muon track can be misidentified as a pion track, so that in the case of B<sup>±</sup> → J/ψ K<sup>±</sup>, with the particle J/ψ decaying into two muons, J/ψ → μ<sup>+</sup>μ<sup>−</sup>, the two muons could me misidentified as pions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can eliminate both kinds of background from your analysis by making sure that particles with c quarks are excluded and by looking at your Dalitz plots and cutting resonances around the masses of the J/ψ particle from your data. "
